Plant diseases and pests detection is a very impor-
tant research content in the feld of machine vision. It 
is a technology that uses machine vision equipment 
to acquire images to judge whether there are diseases 
and pests in the collected plant images.

In recent years, deep learning has made breakthroughs 
in the feld of digital image processing, far superior 
to traditional methods.

We are using Deep Learning for Plant disease detection 
based on images of a leaf of a plant. Deep learning has 
a Convolution neural network that is used to find 
features from the leaf of the plant.
